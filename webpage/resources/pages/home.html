                            I'm an assistant professor in Computer Science at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL) at campus Førde, which is a tiny city hidden away in the innermost depths of a beautiful fjord.
                            I'm also writing up my PhD in algorithms and machine learning at the university of Bergen (UiB).
                            In my PhD I worked on the comutationally hard problem of finding optimal geometric representations of global topological features in data.
                            More generally, I'm interested in complexity theory, computational topology and applications of these fields in other domains.

                        Don't worry, I'm not just a nerd! 
                        Over the years, I've meticulously gathered a wide array of hobbies in a desperate attempt to appear more interesting than I actually am. 
                        My more adventurous pursuits include climbing, swimming, hiking, kayaking, skiing, weightlifting, and windsurfing. 
                        But I also enjoy more laid-back activities like board games, music, and homebrewing.
