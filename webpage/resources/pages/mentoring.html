                    I believe that my role as an advisor is to encourage you to explore your own project and ideas on your own terms.
                    You are the main character and you decide for yourself how you want to do things.
                    My job is to guide you whenever you feel stuck and to suggest new directions when you feel lost. 
                    To help myself live up to these aspirations, I've made a short list of guiding principles that I try follow.
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is <em>your</em> project.</li>
                        <li>I am on your side.</li>
                        <li>I will be patient.</li>
                        <li>I take your project seriously.</li>
                        <li>I encourage you to be independent.</li>
                        <li>Your time is as important as mine.</li>
                        <li>I will not take credit for your work.</li>
                        <li>I want to see you when you make progress.</li>
                        <li>I want to see you when you're stuck.</li>
                        <li>My job is to offer you advice, but you decide if you want to take it.</li>
                        <li>That you are happy is more important than these guidlines.</li>
                    </ul>

                    In short, I want you to feel free and supported.

                    I've had the pleasure of being the mentor of so many creative and unique students. 
                    They have all worked hard and independently on exciting and inovative projects. 
                    Many came to me with their own ideas and everyone had new insights which made each and every project uniquely and distincly <em>theirs</em>. 
                    To any of my students reading this: 
                    Thank you for trusting me to come along with you on your journey.
                    It has been great fun to see how you grew, overcame challenges and managed to exceed all expectations.
                    I'm immensly proud of you all, and I'm deeply impressed by all that you accomplished!
