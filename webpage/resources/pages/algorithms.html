                <h3>Complexity theory</h3>
                <p>Within Parameterized Complexity Theory, I focus on breaking down challenging computational problems into manageable components. By understanding the core challenges of these problems, I develop efficient algorithms for tasks like network analysis and data processing. Recently, I've been exploring the versatility of these algorithms across various domains, including biology and social networks. My objective is not only to address challenges but also to gain deeper insights and share my findings with the broader community.</p>
