                    I'm usually involved with the following courses at HVL:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DAT102: Algorithms and Data Structures</strong><br>
                        Your basic algorithms and data structures course. You will learn how to think properly about the code you are writing, how to tell good code from bad and it really helps you pass coding interviews when you will apply for jobs.</li>
                    <li><strong>DAT108: Programming and Web Applications</strong><br>
                        An introductory course on web development. This is a super useful course where you will learn about both frontend and backend. We will also touch on central concepts like functional programming and paralell programming. </li>
                    <li><strong>DAT158: Machine Learning and Algorithms</strong><br>
                        A hands-on introduction to the machine learning (aka. AI on twitter) wave that's all around us. In addition to diving into algorithms, you will learn about generative AI and how to train your own classification models.</li>
                    <li><strong>DAT191: Bachelor Thesis</strong><br> 
                        This is probably going to be the best and most demanding course of your bachelor degree. 
                        Here you get the opportunity to explore any topic of your choosing and/or to make something new completely from scratch!
