                    Imagine you have a big floor, and you want to cover it with tiles. 
                </p>
                
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                    <figure style="margin: 0;">
                        <img src="../images/tiles.jpg" alt="Description of the image" title="Just for fun!" style="width: 700px; height: auto; border: none; box-shadow: none;">

                <p>    
                    Normally, you'd use square or triangular tiles, right? 
                    Well, Penrose tiling is different. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Instead of using just squares or triangles, you use special shapes that fit together in a very particular way.
                    These shapes are called rhombuses and they have a special property: you can put them together in different combinations without leaving any gaps or overlaps. This makes Penrose tiling really cool because it creates patterns that look the same no matter how far you zoom in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing that makes Penrose tiling even more fascinating is that it's a pattern that never repeats itself exactly. Even though the same shapes are used over and over again, they're arranged in a way that makes the pattern unique and non-repeating, kind of like a never-ending puzzle. It's like having a floor that's always changing but still looks really cool!
