                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Erlend!</p>
                <p>I'm currently working as a lecturer at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL) at campus Førde, which lies hidden away in the innermost depths of a beautiful fjord. (Yes, the view of the city looks excatly like the picture, don't google it).</p>
                <p>I'm also writing up my PhD in computer science from UiB, where I specialized in algorithms and machine learning. I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of complexity theory and topology. My research focuses on finding optimal geometric representatives of global topological features of spaces. </p> 
                <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy weightlifting, climbing, swimming, hiking, kayaking, skiing, boardgames, cooking, brewing, mushroom-hunting and reading, in addition to a variety of other activities that I have carefully curated in order to make me seem more interesting than I actually am.</p>

                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                <p>With over 10 years of teaching experience, I'm dedicated to encouraging a passion for learning and discovery among my students.</p>
                <p>As a dedicated educator, I strive to create an inclusive and dynamic learning environment through student-centric teaching. By adding ever more student active elements to my lectures, I do my best to foster curiosity, collaboration, and critical thinking in my classes. I teach a variety of courses at HVL, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>DAT102: Algorithms and Datastructures Description of the course content and learning objectives.</li>
                    <li>DAT108: Programming and webapplications  Overview of the topics covered and teaching methodologies used.</li>
                    <li>DAT158: Machine learning and algorithms  Explanation of any hands-on projects or practical exercises included in the course.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My teaching philosophy centers on empowering students to become independent learners and problem-solvers. I encourage active participation, peer collaboration, and real-world applications of course concepts.</p>

                <h2>Students</h2>
                <p> I've had the pleasure of mentoring some amazing students through their very exciting projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carbon Capture & Storage (2024): Explanation of any hands-on projects or practical exercises included in the course.</li>
                    <li>Proresult (2024): Overview of the topics covered and teaching methodologies used.</li>
                    <li>Renasys (2024): Algorithms and DatastructuresDescription of the course content and learning objectives.</li>
                    <li>HoTT (2021): </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As an advisor, I try to emulate the philosophy of my own "academic parents" (at the best of my ability). I do my best to give my students the freedom to pursue their own ideas and I encourage them to make their projects their own.</p>

                <h2>Research Interests</h2>
                <p>Welcome to this section, where I go on an in-depth rant about my research interests! I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of computer science and mathematics to address complex challenges. My work revolves around two main areas: Parameterized Complexity Theory and Computational Topology.</p>
            

                <h3>Computer science</h3>

                <h4>Algorithms</h4>

                <h4>Complexity theory</h4>
                <p>Within Parameterized Complexity Theory, I focus on breaking down challenging computational problems into manageable components. By understanding the core challenges of these problems, I develop efficient algorithms for tasks like network analysis and data processing. Recently, I've been exploring the versatility of these algorithms across various domains, including biology and social networks. My objective is not only to address challenges but also to gain deeper insights and share my findings with the broader community.</p>
            
                <h4>Parameterized Algorithms and Complexity Theory</h4>
                

                <img src="resources/images/computer.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

                <h3>Topology</h3>


                <h4>Computational Topology</h4>
                <p>Transitioning to Computational Topology, I investigate the exploration of hidden patterns and structures within complex data. Persistent Homology, in particular, serves as a powerful tool for uncovering these hidden gems, akin to solving a puzzle with data as the pieces. My research endeavors involve the development of efficient algorithms to implement Persistent Homology. By integrating concepts from Parameterized Complexity Theory and Computational Topology, I aim to enhance the accessibility and applicability of these methodologies in addressing real-world challenges. Let's embark on a journey to unravel the mysteries concealed within the data!</p>
